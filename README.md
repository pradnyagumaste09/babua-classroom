## 🎯 The Vision
Most LMS platforms today are "Content Dhandas"—they sell hours of video but fail to build engineering grit. **Babua Classroom** is a practical, no-nonsense platform focused on **real engineering growth**. [cite: 3, 4] [cite_start]We’ve killed the paywall to focus on what matters: logic, patterns, and consistency. 

## 🧠 Product Pillars
**Pattern-Based Learning:** We don't teach problems; we teach the 15 core patterns (Sliding Window, Two Pointers, etc.) that solve 90% of technical interviews. 
**Socratic AI Mentor:** Our AI refuses to give direct code. It uses the Socratic method to guide students through logic, analogies, and edge cases. 
**Babua Talent Passport:** A data-driven profile (Streak + Trust Score) that proves a student’s consistency and honesty to recruiters. 

## 🏗️ System Features
| Feature | Implementation | Babua Mindset |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LMS Core** | Next.js 14 App Router | Structured, fast, and no-nonsense.  |
| **AI Hint System** | OpenAI GPT-4o-mini API | Double-layer guardrails to prevent cheating.  |
| **Auth & Data** | Firebase (Google Auth) | Frictionless entry into the classroom. |
| **Consistency** | LocalStorage + Cloud Sync | "Thoda thoda roj"—Gamified streak tracking.  |

## 💸 Revenue Innovation (Non-Course Sales)
Following the BPL mandate, our revenue model is optional, low-cost, and high-value:

2.  **B2B Talent Matching:** Companies pay to access the "Talent Passport" database to find verified, consistent engineers.
3.  **Mentor Connect:** Optional, paid 1:1 office hours for deep architectural guidance.
